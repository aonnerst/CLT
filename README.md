Please try to  make a small exercise to improve your ROOT and Monte-Carlo knowledge.
The task is to numerically prove the central limit theorem. Basically it says that the distribution of several averages of random samples from any PDF eventually forms a Gaussian. See the attached slide.

So you should write a minimal ROOT macro, which
1. defines your favorite one dimensional PDF (not Gaussian!)
2. repeatedly samples the PDF, averages the samples and fills into a histogram
3. fits a Gaussian to the resulting histogram and draws the thing

Whenever if you have something, send the solution macro to Jasper or me.
